### 1 Vatican North Arrow: https://github.com/do-me/vatican-windrose
The Saint Peter's Square in Vatican/Rome has some really charming North (and South, East, West) arrows. I uploaded four photos here I thought about vectorizing with e.g. https://www.visioncortex.org/vtracer/ to SVG and creating a simple HTML div for e.g. Leaflet maps or similar.

Status: Done :)

## 1 Semantic Search for Encyclopedias
My grandmother has some old German encyclopedia (I think it's Brockhaus) from around the 70s. These books are rarely fully digitized and their knowledge is sort of "trapped" on paper. Of course, it's outdated but for certain purposes (e.g. historians, writers or for scientists) it might be crucial to know at what point of time people knew what, e.g. about climate change, biodiversity, radiation or similar. So depending on your use case, you could create encyclopedia yearly databases and retrieve the historical knowledge. 

In our university library in Heidelberg we had some of these expensive Zetschel quick scanners (but without OCR if I remember corrctly) perfectly suited for digitizing entire books. For an entire collection I guess it would take a whole afternoon. I'd like to run a test at some point but if anyone is quicker, feel free to ping me!
